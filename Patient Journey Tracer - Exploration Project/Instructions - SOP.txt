1. Run the "Pre-processing Step.py" and follow the prompts in the code.
2. Rename the output "<inputfilename>_proc.csv" to "Lines.csv".
3. Run the "PatientJourneyTracer.py" script while having "VisualTreeRosettaCodeDotOrg.py" and "Lines.csv" in the same directory.
4. Open the outputfile "Journey.txt" to find the visualized tree of patient lines.

Note1: The input .csv file must have column names like "Line1", "Line2", "Total", etc. down to capitalization and lengths.
Note2: If any 'codec error's are prompted while running "PatientJourneyTracer.py", rerun the code in a fresh new python session/console.
Note3: An intermediate "JourneyTree.py" is created and used by the above program which doesn't need to be altered by the user.
Note3: Always use a new session for output file generation. Don't rerun or run with a different input file in an old session.
